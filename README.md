# Genji_VisualNovel
Throwback to that time I took a Japanese literature class in undergrad and convinced a couple friends to work with me on making a dating-simulator video game as our final project.  We got an A :D

Unfortunately, I lost the original Python script and game design files in a computer crash, so all I have is the Ren'Py final compiled version.

From the game readme file:
This dating sim is a modern-day adaptation of Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji. The concept ideas, script, photographs, and illustrations for this visual novel are the original work of J--, E--, and Julia. http://www.renpy.org/doc/html/license.html.
